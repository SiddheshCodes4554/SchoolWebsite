Maharashtra Government</b></span></h1><br>
<p style="margin: 8px;font-size: 24px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maharashtra Govt. has launched an ambitious scheme
in the year 1996. The Government has permitted fully residential English Medium School from 6<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> Standard (Science Faculty). The School is affiliated to the Maharashtra state Education Board, Pune. The School is to function on the model of a Central Govt. Sainik School.
</p>
<p style="margin: 8px;font-size: 24px;">
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Maharashtra has launched this ambitious plan in the field
of education to create future officers in the Defence 
Forces. The Sindhudurg District Ex-Servicemen Association has
started the military school for boys at Amboli in October 2003. 
There are classes from 6<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> standard (Science). 
</p>
<p style="margin: 8px;font-size: 24px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School has evolved a balanced curriculum for all round development of each cadet. Along with academics, co-curricular
and extracurricular activities are profiled into the school syllabus.
Special curriculum on leadership development including behaviour
engineering and character formation has given important weightage. 
</p>
<p style="margin: 8px;font-size: 24px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equal emphasis is given to develop physical, mental &
morale faculties of a cadet. The programme is so designed to bring out the best in
a cadet by making the curriculum inter- 
disciplinary and progressive. Each cadet is exposed to all outdoor
activities including boxing, horse riding, obstacle training, firing 
and individual as well as team events. 
</p>
<p style="margin: 8px;font-size: 24px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special cell for leadership development has been added. Service Selection Board (S.S.B.) preparation with emphasis on development of individual leadership qualities and team spirit has been included in the school syllabus for overall development. Military training is also imparted to imbibe military values and greater awareness among the cadets.
</p>
<p style="margin: 8px;font-size: 24px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School has adopted a very dynamic games and sports policy where in every cadet has to participate in all the disciplines of games and sports. In the inter school competitions our cadets have been able to maintain the domination at the district level. Our cadets have displayed splendid performances in half marathon in various venues like western naval command, Vasai-Virar and sawantwadi etc.
</p>
<p style="margin: 8px;font-size: 24px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School performance in the games and sports have been consistently outstanding. Every year the school is in receipt of cash award from Education Department, Sindhudurg.
</p>
<p style="margin: 8px;font-size: 24px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School has a vibrant adventure activity programme. The School adventure team has been performing well at the national level. The main aim of the school is to prepare the final year students for leadership role in the armed forces through NDA, 
NA, AFA & TES. It is a matter of pride to claim that the school
curriculum prepares our cadets for all competitive exams eligible
after class 12. The performance of each cadet is very closely monitored and remedial measures adopted. We respect your decision on considering our school for your ward.
